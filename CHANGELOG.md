# Changelog

All notable changes to Switchyard are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **NeMo Relay native plugin** — a dynamically loaded integration that runs
  libsy's weighted-random and LLM-classifier algorithms in process while
  Switchyard owns provider HTTP dispatch, credentials, translation, retries,
  and fallback. Managed calls require NeMo Relay 0.7 or newer and do not depend
  on `switchyard-server`.

### Changed

- **Switchyard HTTP transport limits** — provider redirects are rejected,
  connection and read-inactivity timeouts are enforced, buffered success and
  error bodies are bounded, and oversized SSE events fail before unbounded line
  buffering. Provider error bodies remain available in typed errors but are no
  longer included in their default display text.

### Removed

- **Latency-aware router** — the `latency_service` route type and its
  `LatencyServiceLLMBackend`, `LatencyServiceBackendConfig`,
  `LatencyServiceEndpoint`, and `LatencyServiceProfileConfig` public API are
  removed. It depended on NVIDIA Inference Hub's latency endpoint and schema.
  Deployments that need multi-endpoint, load- or latency-aware routing should
  migrate to [Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) (backend-load /
  KV-cache-aware routing with request failover) or an external load balancer
  such as [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/routing-configuration/http/load-balancing/service/)
  or HAProxy.
- **Public `type: noop` and `type: passthrough` route types** — removed from
  route bundles. Use `type: model` to register a single explicit model target.
  Catalog auto-discovery via a bare `type: passthrough` route is gone; there is
  no `type: model` equivalent, so list the model ids you want as explicit
  `type: model` routes.

### Fixed

- **Response `model` now names the model that actually served the request**, on
  every serving path and wire format. Streamed Anthropic and Responses replies,
  and every libsy-served reply, previously echoed the model id the client
  requested — for a route bundle whose key is an alias, that meant the alias
  rather than the routed target, so trajectories, dashboards, and client UIs
  labelled routed turns with the route name. The routed model was already
  reported by `x-model-router-selected-model`, `x-switchyard-selected-model`,
  `/v1/routing/stats`, and Intake's `served_model`; the response body now agrees
  with them. Streamed OpenAI Chat replies report the routed target instead of
  the provider's own id, and no longer fall back to `"unknown"` when a provider
  omits `model` on delta chunks.

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

First public release of Switchyard — a typed, composable control plane for LLM
traffic that sits between client applications and LLM backends.

### Added

- **Four-role chain** — `RequestProcessor → LLMBackend → ResponseProcessor →
  TranslationEngine`, executed by the Rust-backed core. See
  [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Protocol translation** — convert between OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic
  Messages, and OpenAI Responses wire formats, so each client keeps speaking its
  native API regardless of the upstream backend.
- **YAML route bundles** (`switchyard serve --routing-profiles`) — one bundle,
  many named routes, each its own chain. Supported route `type`s: `model`,
  `passthrough`, `random_routing`, `stage_router`, `deterministic`
  (LLM-as-classifier), `latency_service`, and `noop`.
- **Routing strategies** — weighted random split, signal-driven **stage-router**
  escalation (see [Stage-Router Routing](docs/stage_router_routing.md)),
  LLM-as-classifier strong/weak routing, and latency-aware multi-endpoint
  failover.
- **One-command launchers** — `switchyard launch claude`, `launch codex`, and
  `launch openclaw` spin up a local proxy and drop you into the target CLI.
  All three **default to LLM-as-classifier routing** (validated coding-agent
  trio) with `--model` / `--routing-profiles` to opt out.
- **CLI** — `serve`, `launch`, `configure` (saved defaults, `--show`,
  `--list-models`), and `verify` / `launch --smoke` round-trip checks.
- **Observability** — Prometheus `/metrics`, a JSON `/v1/stats`
  (`/v1/routing/stats` alias), and per-request cost/token/latency stats. See
  [Metrics Reference](docs/METRICS_REFERENCE.md).
- **Python library** — `ProfileSwitchyard` driven by typed profile configs
  (`PassthroughProfileConfig`, `RandomRoutingProfileConfig`,
  `StageRouterProfileConfig`, …) and typed `ChatRequest` / `ChatResponse`
  containers for in-process use.
- **Rust core** (PyO3) — chain execution, the latency-aware router, and the
  tool-result signal collector are implemented in Rust and re-exported to
  Python.
- **Packaging** — `pip install nemo-switchyard` with optional extras `[server]`,
  `[cli]`, `[tracing]`, `[intake]`, `[affinity-redis]`, `[all]`. See
  [Installation](INSTALLATION.md).

### Notes

- The `--deterministic` launcher flag was removed during pre-release
  development — LLM-as-classifier routing is now the implicit default for the
  `claude` / `codex` / `openclaw` launchers.
- Inference Hub integration docs are out of scope for this release.
