# Switchyard NeMo Relay Dynamic Plugin

This crate builds the external `nvidia.switchyard` native plugin. It embeds
`switchyard-libsy`, drives `Algorithm::run_stream`, and uses
`switchyard-llm-client` for provider HTTP calls. Managed calls use Relay's
completion-based asynchronous middleware hooks and do not require a targeted
provider continuation from Relay.

The plugin uses NeMo Relay native API v1. It depends on the small
`nemo-relay-plugin` authoring SDK, not the Relay runtime, and does not start
`switchyard-server`. Managed provider calls do not use Relay's provider
continuation.

## Ownership boundary

For a managed LLM call:

1. Relay invokes the native LLM execution intercept.
2. The plugin decodes the caller JSON through `switchyard-translation`.
3. The plugin drives the configured libsy algorithm with `run_stream` and
   records each genuine decision.
4. For every `CallLlm`, the plugin's `switchyard-llm-client` instance translates
   the neutral request, applies the selected target's URL and credentials, and
   performs the HTTP request.
5. The plugin passes the real buffered response or response stream to
   `CallLlmRequest::respond` and continues until `ReturnToAgent`.
6. The plugin encodes the final neutral response into the caller's protocol.

Relay still owns the outer LLM lifecycle, dynamic-plugin loading, plugin
configuration, and event substrate. Relay's downstream LLM continuation is
used only for calls whose inbound protocol is not managed by this plugin.

    U["Unmanaged profile"] -.-> V["Relay v1 continuation"]
```

This boundary has two important consequences:

- Managed provider calls do not traverse Relay middleware registered after the
  Switchyard intercept and do not use the host's provider callback. Provider
  transport activity is therefore not represented as nested Relay LLM
  lifecycle events. Relay records the outer managed call and the plugin emits
  Switchyard routing marks; bridging Switchyard transport spans into Relay is
  future work. The adapter captures the active Relay scope before returning
  `Pending`, so asynchronous routing marks retain their event parent.
- Switchyard owns provider URLs, credentials, HTTP retry behavior, and
  translation for managed calls. Relay neither validates nor transports those
  target details.

## Native API v1 and asynchronous execution

The manifest remains `compat.native_api = "1"`, but the plugin requires the
generic host-table v3 extension shipped by Relay 0.7. It registers through
v3's completion-based buffered and incremental streaming hooks, returns
`Pending` immediately, and performs libsy and provider HTTP work on a
plugin-owned Tokio runtime. Relay workers therefore do not wait synchronously
for provider I/O.

The stream adapter forwards the plugin's bounded 32-message channel into
Relay's bounded output queue. It retries a logical event when the host queue is
full and checks cancellation between attempts. Managed HTTP work is selected
against Relay caller cancellation, so cancelling a buffered or streaming call
drops its in-flight provider future.

Unmanaged profiles use the same v3 continuation hooks for pass-through. V3's
downstream stream callback has continue/cancel control but no asynchronous
acknowledgement, so the adapter uses a nonblocking bridge capped at 8 MiB of
queued encoded payloads and 256 events. A pass-through stream that outruns
either bound is rejected rather than consuming unbounded memory.

This is a raw C boundary: Switchyard contains a small ownership adapter for
host strings, completion and stream handles, continuation handles, and captured
scope handles because Relay 0.7 does not expose a safe Rust facade for its
generic asynchronous surface. The HTTP, routing, and translation behavior
remains in Switchyard. The adapter can be replaced with the safe typed surface
when Relay exposes equivalent asynchronous callbacks and cancellation.

## Supported routers

The plugin supports four libsy routing modes:

- seeded, weighted `random` routing; and
- capability-based `llm_classifier` routing, where a judge selects the weak or
  strong target before the final provider call;
- escalation-mode `llm_classifier` routing, where a judge evaluates the weak
  model's completed turn and latches a session to the strong target after a
  configured confirmation streak; and
- signal-driven `stage_router` routing, with optional handoff notes, tier
  prompts, and a capability-classifier fallback for ambiguous turns.

Unsupported algorithm kinds are rejected instead of being approximated.

## Compatibility Matrix

The following matrix describes the algorithm behavior implemented by the
plugin. `Conditional` means that the feature is implemented with the constraint
shown in the table; it does not mean that the feature falls back to a different
algorithm.

| Compatibility Area | `random` | `llm_classifier` (`capability`) | `llm_classifier` (`escalation`) | `stage_router` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Version-2 configuration and static validation | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Caller protocols | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages |
| Serving-target protocols | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages |
| Structured-output judge protocols | Not applicable | OpenAI Chat or OpenAI Responses | OpenAI Chat or OpenAI Responses | OpenAI Chat or OpenAI Responses for the optional classifier |
| Buffered responses | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Streaming responses | Supported | Supported after the judge selects a target | Conditional: an unlatched weak stream is aggregated before the judge runs | Supported after the signal cascade selects a target |
| Retained routing state | No selection affinity; context-overflow eviction can use session identity | Optional session affinity and message-hash fallback | Confirmation streak and strong latch require stable session identity | No classifier affinity; context-overflow eviction can use session identity |
| Router-specific prompts | Not applicable | Optional judge prompt | Optional escalation-judge prompt | Optional tier prompts, handoff notes, and classifier prompt |
| Relay decision marks | Algorithm, attempt, selected target, and identity; routing tier is `null` | Algorithm, attempt, selected target, weak or strong routing tier, and identity | Algorithm, attempt, selected target, weak or strong routing tier, and identity | Algorithm, attempt, selected target, routing tier, decision source, and identity |

Anthropic Messages is supported for callers and serving targets, but not for a
structured-output judge. That restriction is intentional and fails during
static configuration loading. Same-protocol streaming preserves parsed provider
events when the router does not aggregate or replace them; raw SSE bytes and
framing are not part of the compatibility contract.

### Known issue: OpenAI Responses structured-output judges

OpenAI Responses targets are accepted for structured-output judges, but the
shared Responses request encoder currently emits the Chat-compatible JSON
Schema object directly under `text.format`. This places `name`, `schema`, and
`strict` under `text.format.json_schema`; conforming Responses endpoints expect
those fields directly under `text.format`. InferenceHub therefore returns HTTP
400 with `Missing required parameter: 'text.format.name'`, and the affected
router follows its existing judge-failure or fall-open path.

A hosted Relay process run passed 20 of 23 router-matrix cases. The only
failures were the Responses-judge variants of the capability classifier,
escalation router, and stage classifier fallback. OpenAI Responses remains
verified as a caller and ordinary serving-target protocol. Until the shared
`switchyard-translation` encoder is corrected, configure structured-output
judges with `protocol = "openai_chat"`. Follow-up work must add the inverse of
the existing Responses-to-neutral schema conversion plus core and
process-level regression coverage for all three affected router paths.

The following integration components have not reached complete compatibility.
`Not built` identifies missing integration work rather than a hidden or
best-effort runtime path.

| Compatibility Component | Status | Current Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned Relay process-level acceptance harness | Not built | Unit and workspace tests run in CI. Relay 0.7.1 plus Ollama smoke coverage is manual and currently covers OpenAI Chat paths for escalation and stage routing. |
| OpenAI Responses and Anthropic Messages process-level routing matrix | Not built | Translation and in-process runtime coverage exists, including stage signals across all three caller protocols, but no automated Relay gateway matrix exercises every algorithm and target combination. |
| Real coding-agent acceptance harness | Not built | Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes sessions are not driven automatically through the packaged plugin. |
| Hosted-provider certification | Not built | No automated suite qualifies structured-output judges, serving targets, latency, or token cost against hosted provider APIs. |
| Native bundle platform and Relay-version matrix | Partial | The workspace builds in Linux CI and the plugin was smoked manually on macOS arm64 with Relay 0.7.1. Dedicated packaged-plugin jobs do not yet cover Linux and Windows bundles or every supported Relay 0.7 release. |
| Dynamic-plugin lifecycle automation | Partial | Manifest validation, registration, enablement, execution, and unload were exercised manually; they are not part of a repeatable CI acceptance test. |
| Nested Relay lifecycle telemetry for managed provider calls | Not built | Relay records the outer call and Switchyard routing marks. Switchyard provider HTTP spans are not bridged into nested Relay LLM events. |
| Provider `Retry-After` propagation | Not built | The outer routing loop uses bounded exponential backoff because the client error contract does not expose `Retry-After`. |
| Cross-protocol streaming loss diagnostics | Not built | Cross-protocol streams use normalized chunks, but the stream adapter does not surface the buffered translation engine's reject-lossy diagnostics. |
| Safe typed Relay asynchronous host adapter | Blocked on host API | The plugin uses its tested raw C ownership adapter until Relay exposes an equivalent safe asynchronous Rust facade. |

Managed inner provider calls also do not re-enter Relay's downstream provider
middleware. This behavior is part of the current ownership boundary, not an
automatic compatibility fallback.

The plugin owns the outer routing retry loop. Each retry starts a fresh libsy
run. Random routing draws again; an algorithm configured with persistent state,
such as classifier session affinity, may intentionally retain its assignment.
Each target's built-in HTTP retry count is set to zero to avoid retrying a
failed target invisibly before reselection. A random target with `weight = 0`
is fallback-only and is not considered by the algorithm. Trusted fallback is
attempted at most once and, for streaming responses, only before the first
caller event is emitted. Outer routing retries use exponential backoff starting
at 250 milliseconds and capped at 2 seconds. They do not currently honor
provider `Retry-After` headers because the client error contract does not expose
that metadata to the routing loop.

## Translation and stream fidelity

`switchyard-translation` is the only request, response, and event translation
layer. It decodes caller JSON into Switchyard's neutral protocol, encodes each
selected call for the target protocol, decodes provider results, and encodes
`ReturnToAgent` back to the caller protocol. Relay codecs are not used.

The streaming contract carries each parsed provider JSON event in a preservation
envelope alongside its normalized `LlmResponseChunk` representation.
Same-protocol routes replay the preserved JSON unchanged, including
provider-specific fields; this preserves parsed events, not raw SSE bytes or
framing. Cross-protocol routes encode only normalized chunks, and the streaming
helpers still do not expose the buffered translation engine's reject-lossy
diagnostics, so unsupported fields may be normalized or omitted. Replacing
normalized stream content or folding a stream into an aggregate drops the
per-event preservation envelope.

## Configuration

The manifest declares `compat.native_api = "1"` and Relay `>=0.7.0,<0.8`, and
the Rust SDK uses the exact published `0.7.0` crate. The manifest API value
selects Relay's released native plugin contract; the binary also requires the
v3 C host table shipped on the Relay 0.7 line. Rebuild the bundle when changing
SDK versions rather than assuming Rust dynamic-library compatibility from the
manifest value alone.

A Relay project can configure a seeded weighted-random router as follows:

```toml
version = 1

[[plugins.dynamic]]
manifest = "/opt/switchyard-relay-plugin/relay-plugin.toml"

[plugins.dynamic.config]
version = 2
priority = 0
max_retries = 3

[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm]
kind = "random"
seed = 42

[plugins.dynamic.config.default_targets]
openai_chat = "fast"

[plugins.dynamic.config.targets.fast]
model = "provider/model"
protocol = "openai_chat"
endpoint = "/v1/chat/completions"
base_url = "https://provider.example.com"
weight = 1
drop_caller_extra_body = true

[plugins.dynamic.config.targets.fast.header_env]
authorization = "PROVIDER_AUTHORIZATION"
```

Target map keys such as `fast` are stable semantic names visible to libsy. The
target binding is authoritative for the provider model, protocol, endpoint,
base URL, weight, and environment-backed headers. Each `default_targets` key
both enables that inbound protocol and names its trusted fallback.

`header_env` is the only custom provider-header source. It resolves values in
the plugin process at registration time so literal header values never appear
in configuration. Environment values must not appear in errors, routing marks,
spans, or debug output. The plugin does not inherit caller credentials for
managed calls. Each variable supplies the complete header value, so an
`authorization` value must include its scheme, such as `Bearer`. Literal
`headers` configuration is rejected; non-secret routing or tenancy headers must
also use `header_env`.

Relay may intercept an OpenAI SDK call before the SDK materializes its
`extra_body` option into a provider request. Targets that reject this
caller-specific wrapper can set `drop_caller_extra_body = true`. The plugin
then drops the wrapper and its contents; it does not promote those values to
top-level provider fields. The default is `false` so lossless same-format
forwarding remains unchanged for targets that consume the extension.

`extra_body` supplies non-secret provider defaults for a target. It is useful
for provider-specific controls such as disabling reasoning on a dedicated
judge model. Fields already present on the caller's request take precedence.
Do not put credentials in `extra_body`; use `header_env` for secrets.

For `kind = "llm_classifier"`, the classifier target must use `openai_chat` or
`openai_responses`; libsy's judge request uses a JSON-schema response format
that cannot be represented losslessly by Anthropic Messages. Omitting `mode`
selects `capability`, preserving the original version-2 configuration shape.

Escalation mode evaluates the weak model's completed response before returning
it or replacing it with a strong-model response:

```toml
[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm]
kind = "llm_classifier"
mode = "escalation"
classifier_target = "judge"
weak_target = "weak"
strong_target = "strong"
prompt = "Judge whether the weak model is stuck."
max_output_tokens = 512

[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm.escalation]
confirmations = 2
recent_turn_window = 28
window_message_chars = 500
```

`judge`, `weak`, and `strong` are keys in
`plugins.dynamic.config.targets`, configured with the same model, protocol,
URL, and `header_env` fields shown above. The judge must use `openai_chat` or
`openai_responses`; the serving targets may use any supported protocol.

Use a dedicated, non-reasoning model for the judge when possible. Providers
that expose a reasoning switch can configure it on that target, for example:

```toml
[plugins.dynamic.config.targets.judge]
model = "provider/non-reasoning-judge"
protocol = "openai_chat"
base_url = "https://provider.example.com"
extra_body = { think = false }
```

The packaged escalation rubric is intentionally detailed and can consume
roughly two thousand or more input tokens depending on the tokenizer. Every
unlatched request also pays for a complete judge call. A custom `prompt` can
reduce that cost, but should be evaluated against representative trajectories
before deployment. Reasoning models may spend `max_output_tokens` on hidden or
visible reasoning before returning the structured verdict; disable reasoning
with provider-supported `extra_body` controls or raise the cap after measuring.

An unlatched streaming escalation request is intentionally buffered. Libsy must
read the complete weak response before asking the judge, so caller first-token
delivery waits for the weak call and judge verdict. A declined escalation is
reconstructed as a stream from the aggregate response, which drops the
provider-event preservation envelope. A confirmed escalation discards that
weak response and serves the strong target.

The default `confirmations = 2` retains a streak per Switchyard session. Callers
must send a stable `x-switchyard-session-id` header for the streak and strong
latch to survive across turns. Without session identity each request has
isolated state and a multi-confirmation escalation cannot latch.

A full stage router can combine tool-result signals, model-specific prompts,
handoff notes, and an optional judge for ambiguous turns:

```toml
[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm]
kind = "stage_router"
capable_target = "strong"
efficient_target = "weak"
picker = "efficient_first"
confidence_threshold = 0.5
recent_turn_window = 3
capable_system_prompt = "Diagnose before editing."
efficient_system_prompt = "Follow the settled plan."

[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm.handoff_notes]
escalation_note = "The previous model was stalling; pick up the diagnosis."
deescalation_note = "The task is settled; continue with the mechanical work."
only_on_wrong_signal_escalation = true

[plugins.dynamic.config.algorithm.classifier]
target = "judge"
base_threshold = 0.5
threshold_step = 0.1
recent_turn_window = 3
prompt = "Estimate whether the efficient target can finish this turn."
max_output_tokens = 512
```

Stage routing reads normalized tool calls and tool results from OpenAI Chat,
OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages traffic. When the signals do not cross
`confidence_threshold`, the optional classifier decides; if it is absent or
cannot decide, the configured picker's default tier serves the turn. The
classifier target has the same structured-output protocol restriction as the
standalone classifier.

Ambiguous turns that reach the optional classifier add one judge call;
decisive tool signals do not. Decision marks include `routing_tier` for signal,
classifier, and picker-default paths, plus `decision_source` (`override`,
`tests_passed`, `dimensions`, `llm-classifier`, or `fall_open`) for stage-router
explainability.

Version-1 service configuration, decision-only execution, and observe-only
mode are rejected.

## Build and bundle

The crate is a source/build unit with `publish = false`. Operators install a
binary bundle rather than a Rust crate:

```bash
cargo build --release -p switchyard-nemo-relay-plugin
python3 crates/switchyard-nemo-relay-plugin/scripts/package_bundle.py \
  --library target/release/libswitchyard_nemo_relay_plugin.so \
  --output dist/switchyard-nemo-relay-plugin-linux-x86_64
```

On macOS the library suffix is `.dylib`; Windows builds use `.dll`. The bundle
builder creates the minimal Relay package: the shared library, a materialized
manifest with Relay's inline SHA-256 integrity digest, and the JSON schema.

Install the materialized bundle with Relay's normal lifecycle commands:

```bash
nemo-relay plugins validate /opt/switchyard-relay-plugin/relay-plugin.toml
nemo-relay plugins add /opt/switchyard-relay-plugin/relay-plugin.toml
nemo-relay plugins enable nvidia.switchyard
nemo-relay plugins inspect nvidia.switchyard
```

## Validation expectations

Before release, validate both routers against buffered and streaming OpenAI
Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages providers. The acceptance suite
must cover same- and supported cross-protocol routes, deterministic weighted
routing, independent runs, classifier weak and strong selections, retry
reselection, exhaustion, exactly-once fallback, stream commitment, empty
streams, late errors, cancellation, credential privacy, and unmanaged
pass-through.

The tests must also prove that managed target traffic reaches the provider
through `switchyard-llm-client`, never through Relay's provider continuation,
and that no Switchyard service or health endpoint is involved.
