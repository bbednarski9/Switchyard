//! The routed-call server trait and the routing decision it carries.
//!
//! [`RoutedLlmClient`] is the one piece of I/O the protocol does not own: a host
//! implements it to actually perform a model call. [`Decision`] is the routing
//! decision that produced the call, carried alongside so the client and any
//! observer can see which model was chosen and why. Both live here — rather than
//! in libsy's orchestration crate — so a client crate that depends only on the
//! protocol can serve routed calls without pulling in the orchestrator.
